# Voronoi diagrams

This is a project made with [raylib-rs](https://github.com/deltaphc/raylib-rs) that generates random voronoi diagrams

Features:

- Add points to the diagram by clicking
- Reset and re-randomise the points by pressing R
- Points scale depending on how close your mouse is

To Do:

- [ ] Sort out colours using [Four colour theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem)
- [ ] Make points prettier using complimentary colours
- [x] Drag around points
- [x] Delete points
- [x] Fully configurable
- [x] Optimise by using fewer iterations over points
- [x] Add noise to colours
- [ ] Move points around a bit 
- [ ] Edge mode
